# Unity Native Rendering on **Android/iOS**
* Using Native Rendering(OpenGL ES) as Unity Plugin to render on **Android/iOS**

* This repository was originally published in bitbucket using mercurial:

* * https://bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies/graphicsdemos

* I (and I think most people) found it in [Unity docs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/NativePluginInterface.html).

* I transfered it into git using [fast-export](https://github.com/frej/fast-export) with the method of the best Answer of [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16037787/convert-mercurial-project-to-git).

* The original repository doesn't directly support android/ios. Though there's code try to do so, it's not finished yet.

* I just made a few change to render the content on **Android/iOS**. I know it's not the best(or even a proper) way, but it works. :)

* Tested on Unity 5.5.2f1 and 5.6.4p1
